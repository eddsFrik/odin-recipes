        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>This decadent crockpot hot chocolate is easy to make with milk, condensed milk, cream, chocolate chips, and
            vanilla in the slow cooker.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <p>Here's what you'll need to make the best slow cooker hot chocolate of your life:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>6 cups milk:</strong> This easy slow cooker hot chocolate starts with regular milk (whole or
                reduced-fat will work best). If you use an alternative milk, opt for something creamy like oat milk.
            </li>

            <li><strong>2 cups chocolate chips:</strong> Semisweet chocolate chips create a perfectly balanced flavor.
                You
                could also use milk or dark chocolate chips.</li>

            <li><strong>1 Â½ heavy whipping cream:</strong> Heavy whipping cream is the key to a creamy, decadent, rich
                slow
                cooker hot chocolate.</li>

            <li><strong>1 (14 ounce) sweetened condensed milk:</strong> Like so many decadent recipes, this hot
                chocolate
                calls for a can of sweetened condensed milk.</li>

            <li><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla:</strong> A teaspoon of vanilla extract lends complexity and takes the
                overall
                flavor up a notch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Combine milk, chocolate chips, cream, condensed milk, and vanilla in a slow cooker.</li>

            <li>Cover and cook on Low, stirring occasionally, until chocolate chips are melted and mixture is smooth,
                about
                2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
